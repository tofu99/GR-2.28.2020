# Russian Roulete RPG System

## Character Sheets

### Introduction

A character sheet is simply a list of skills, items, and qualities, with the skills the player has invested in having a higher level.

### Storing the Character Sheet

The physical character sheet doesn't have to have these three things in order, or in the same place. 
It's most likely that you store your character on a piece of paper or in a text document, but you could also scratch it into 
the sidewalk, carve it into a pumpkin, or even scribble it onto the wall with crayon. It's only important that you get
your character data stored somehow, or at least memorize it.

### What it contains

Character sheets should contain:

- An inventory (what items/gear your character has)
- The characters qualities (the characters traits and personalities)
- Skills (what your character is good at)

## Dice Checks/DCs

During play, certain tasks will have a DC (Dice Check). The DC equates to the number of six sided dice a player has to roll. 
Any ones rolled at the end of the check result in a fail (hence Russian Roulete). One or more skill level(s) allows people to reroll 
a number of dice that landed on `one` equal to their level in the skills required to perform the task plus any relvent item bonus. For DCs for tasks that use multiple skills, simply add all of the skill levels together. Negative skill levels will subtract from the number of dice that you can reroll.

### A Simple Example

A really mean DM (or a stupid one) might give you a DC of thirty-six for the task of making a sandwich. The skills required would be crafting, cooking, and tools, and you have `1`, `-2`, and `5` levels in each of them respectively. This means you roll thirty-six dice (as the DC is `36`), you can re-roll up to `1 - 2 + 5 = 4` ones, and if you end up with any ones left over, you fail the task.

## Qualities

The last thing on the character sheet are qualities. Qualities are essentially a description of your character's appearance, personality, fears, etc.. In the Russian Roulette system, there is no HP, only conditions that are made by your DM or campaign writer such as asleep, unconscious, dead, undead, mesmerized, etc..

## Items

Items will give you a level bonus to certain tasks. For example, a `+4` item would let you re-roll four dice (that rolled ones). The number of dice rolled is the DC of the check. An item is described with a name, a skill bonus,
and what skill it adds to.

### Item Effects

Some items such as weapons will have effects that are applied to things they are used on, for example, a small knife will have the effect of, "Shallow Wound". If an item doesn't have a stated effect, feel free to make one up that sounds reasonable.

## Creating a Campaign

If you are making a campaign with this system, it's a bit like the real thing this system is named after, the rules are simple, 
and if you lose, something bad happens.
If you are the DM, you can choose what that bad thing is. You must first create a goal for the 
players to try to reach, and then put stuff in the way. These obstacles can be as a simple as a locked door or a short hike,
but can be as complicated as a magic puzzle or a full blown heist. These can be represented rules wise as a bunch of skill
checks, roleplaying, or a scavenger hunt, but remember that using only one type of rule for all the obstacles in the campaign
is a strong sign of incompetence. If you didn't give your players a list of skills to choose from, don't be mean and
make your players' skills useless just because the name of their skill ends with -ing (climb instead of climbing).

## Skills and Skill Points

Skills represent how good a character is at a specific task. Some example would be `Aim`, which could represent how well a character could aim with a bow. When the DM calls from a skill check, you can apply the relevent skills to increase the ammount of `ones` that you can re-roll.

### Creating Skills

This system is intended to be more roleplaying focused, and it probably won't matter if you make up skills. Like skills, items are to be homebrewed, so I will not provide you with a list of premade items or skills as they are up to the DM to create. In fact, your DM could make a campaign where "Strength" didn't exist as a skill, if they decided that "Student Simulator" would make a good campaign.  

When a player makes a character sheet, obviously it is unfair to allow them to have infinite total skill points, so when they first
make their characters, they get a total of thirty-six points to spend on whatever skills they so desire. If you are the DM, you can 
decide how many new skill points your players get to spend and when they get to spend them.

### Conditional Skills

In addition, certain skills are conditional skills or C-skills for short. These skills require certain conditions to be met to be applicable.
Archery is an example of a C-skill, as you need a bow and arrow to use your archery skills. Other conditions could be being in a dark room to use a nightvision skill or having cooking implements to use cooking skills.

### Skills that Require Tools

There are certain tasks that would normally require tools, such as removing nuts and bolts. If they are rusty, you could require your players to use a wrench, but if it simply loosely tightened, your players could try using a strength skill check to try removing the nut with their fingers.

### Improving Skills

There are no levels in this system, as skills are improved the more they are used. Every time you use a skill and succeed on the skill check,
roll three six-sided dice, and if you roll three ones, add one level to that skill. Of course you can also increase skill levels by studying
or practicing. Each hour you practice or study, again, roll two six sided dice, but this time, if you roll two sixes, roll another six sided die,
and divide the result by two, rounding up, and add what you get to the level of whatever skill you are practicing/studying for.

## Combat

Combat is also an important aspect of any RPG system, so I will define the rules for that now. When you are attacking something, 
you make a skill check for whatever skill you are using to attack, and the number of dice you would have to roll for that check 
would be the level of whatever skill the defender is using for defense plus five. For example, if Bob was going to attempt to 
kill Wade with a sword, and Wade was going to try to climb up a tree, Bob would make a swordwork skill check (or something 
similar), and the number of dice he would roll would be equal to Wade's skill level in climbing plus five. If Bob's skill in 
Swordwork was ten, and Wade's skill in climbing was 3, Bob would roll `3 + 5 = 8` dice, and he could reroll a total of ten ones. 
If Bob succeeds the skill check, his attack is successful, and in this case, Wade would be totally screwed. 
Item bonuses still apply. For clarification, what happens when the attack succeeds depends entirely upon the weapon used and
how lethal or where the attack was supposed to be. It is only important that you use your common sense. Item effects like 
debuffs from poison or something like that should be listed in the item description.

### Random Strikes

Random strikes happen when a player doesn't specify where they are aiming, are reacting to a surprise attack, or because of 
conditions that would cause dizziness or similar effects. When an attacker strikes randomly, they roll a six sided die to determine where the strike lands. A six is a strike to the head, a five is a strike to the neck, a four is a strike to the upper torso, a three is a strike to the lower torso or arms, a two is a strike to the legs, and a one is a strike to the feet. The attacker then rolls another six sided die to determine which side of the body the strike landed on. An even number determines the right side, an odd number determines the left. If the strike is to the lower torso or arms, an odd number results in a strike to the arms, the die is rolled again to determine which arm is hit, using the same rules above.

### Surprise Attacks

A surprise attack is when the attacker attacks something that hasn't noticed it yet. The defender gets a Reaction, in which they 
can counter-attack their attacker. If the counter-attack succeeds, it will be a Random Strike, unless the defender has something 
that lets them hit normally.

## Example Item Table:

Here is an example of a table of basic weapons, you can see the the Bow of Seeking has a `+5` to Archery because arrows shot from 
it will seek out thier targets! There can obviously be more weapons than described here.

| Item Name      | Affected Skill | Skill bonus | Consumables                  | Effects             |
